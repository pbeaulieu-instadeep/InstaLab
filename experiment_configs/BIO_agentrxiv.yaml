# Here is the research prompt. If num-papers-to-write > 1, you can treat this as a "research direction"
# otherwise it can be *very* specific and can be treated as a full research idea
research-topic:
  - "Your goal is to design reasoning and prompt engineering techniques to maximize FRANK scores median"
  - "on CD8 epitopes dataset to beat the netmhcpan4.1 benchmark by fine tuning gemini. Your idea should be very novel."

  plan-formulation:
    - 'You should come up with a plan for only ONE experiment aimed at maximizing performance on the test set of MS Ligands from netmhcpan4.1'
    - 'using prompting and biology techniques.'
    - 'The baseline performance of NetMHCpan-4.1 on FRANK scores median is 	0.0021'
    - 'Please use gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25 for your experiments'
    - 'You must evaluate on the entire CD8 epitopes dataset'
    - 'Your plan should be a novel prompting/enginerering technique'
    - 'Your evaluation shound aim to get state-of-the-art performance on the CD8 epitopes dataset using a novel prompting idea'
    - "DO NOT PLAN FOR TOO LONG. Submit your plan soon."
  report-writing:
    - 'The baseline performance of NetMHCpan-4.1 on FRANK scores median is 	0.0021'
